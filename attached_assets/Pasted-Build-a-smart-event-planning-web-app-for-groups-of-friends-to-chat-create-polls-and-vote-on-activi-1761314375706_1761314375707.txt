Build a smart event planning web app for groups of friends to chat, create polls, and vote on activities like watching a movie or going out.
The app must be built using Next.js + Appwrite, have a modern, aesthetic design, be responsive, and feature smooth animations.

💻 Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN/UI (for polished UI)

Animations: Framer Motion

State Management: Zustand

Forms: React Hook Form + Zod

Icons & Emojis: Lucide React + Emoji Mart

Notifications: Sonner or React Hot Toast

Themes: next-themes (dark/light)

Backend (ONLY): Appwrite

Authentication (Appwrite Auth)

Database (Appwrite Collections)

File Storage (avatars, poll images)

Realtime updates (chat, voting, group activity)

External APIs:

TMDB API (for movie details)

Google Places API (for place details)

Deployment:

Frontend → Vercel

Backend → Appwrite Cloud or self-hosted

🔐 Environment Configuration

All API keys and Appwrite credentials must be listed in .env.local for easy editing later.
Example:

NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=
TMDB_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=


Use these environment variables throughout the app for authentication, API fetches, and configuration.

🗂️ App Pages / Routes

/auth/register – Registration page using Appwrite Auth.

/auth/login – Login with email/password (Appwrite).

/dashboard – User dashboard showing all joined groups and create new group option.

/groups/[groupId] –

🧱 Appwrite Database Collections

Users → name, email, avatar, bio

All chat messages, user data, polls, and group data must be stored and fetched only from Appwrite Database.

✨ Goal

Deliver a real-time, beautifully animated event planner app using Next.js + Appwrite only for all backend needs (auth, chat, storage, realtime).
All API keys and credentials must be editable via .env.local.
App should look clean, friendly, and work seamlessly on mobile and desktop.
