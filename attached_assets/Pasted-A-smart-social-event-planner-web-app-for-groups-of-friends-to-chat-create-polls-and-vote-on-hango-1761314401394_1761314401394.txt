A smart, social event planner web app for groups of friends to chat, create polls, and vote on hangouts.
The UI should be clean, animated, responsive, and modern — inspired by apps like Discord, WhatsApp, and Doodle.

All backend logic, chat storage, authentication, and realtime features are handled only by Appwrite.

All user data, groups, messages, polls, and votes are stored and fetched only from Appwrite Database.

Use Appwrite Realtime for instant updates on chat messages and polls.

Store all API keys and endpoints in .env.local:

NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=
TMDB_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=


Use fetch or axios with these keys to query TMDB and Google Places APIs.
